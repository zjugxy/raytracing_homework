## many problems needs to be solved
1.to slow,need write in cuda 

2.the specular mtl and transparent mtl's scatter function exist some error. The way to choose which type of sampling or whether to refract is just determine by a random number and a number I defined randomly.

3. the code is shit. I need to write a Integal class to address this problem. For three scene,I write 3 shader function.
